			<h2>How to Play</h2>
			
			<p class="description">
				The game is a turn-based monster fighting game. So each turn you select a move,
				and then both monsters (pocketdudes) perform their move. To win, you must defeat
				three of the opponent's pocketdudes. You are given three random pocketdudes.
			</p>
			
			<p class="description">
				The stats are named weirdly (as a joke) and the following are the correlation to
				the stats:
				<ul>
					<li>Health &Rightarrow; Swag</li>
					<li>Attack &Rightarrow; Hustle</li>
					<li>Defense &Rightarrow; Thiccness</li>
					<li>Special Attack &Rightarrow; Pimpness</li>
					<li>Special Defense &Rightarrow; Awesomeness</li>
					<li>Speed &Rightarrow; Quickness</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>NOTE</h3>
			
			<p class="description">
				<b>The game will be displayed above the menu above!</b> And the menu will jump to the bottom
				of the page! This is because the game made to be on the entire screen, so input starts
				at 0. I cannot change the code, since I had to minify it (since it was made for a friend's
				website and he asked to keep it small). So instead of remaking it, I had to just let the
				game window start from the top. This way the input isn't confusing.
			</p>
			
			<p class="description">
				There is also a weird bug, that I probably overlooked, in which the descriptions
				of the moves overflow into the next part of the tooltip. I wish I could fix this,
				but I would need to rewrite the entire game (since it's been minified). To remedy
				this, <a href="dudedex.html">here is a link</a> that gives full descriptions of
				each pocketdude, their moves, their stats, the move descriptions, and it's stats.
