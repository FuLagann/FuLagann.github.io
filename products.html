				<a name="open-graphing-calculator"><h2>Open Graphing Calculator</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					This is an open source graphing calcultor that I collaborated with a math
					professor that was inspired by
					<a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a>. It was made using JavaScript,
					<a href="https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html">JSXGraph</a>,
					<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, and
					<a href="http://mathquill.com/">MathQuill</a>.
					There was a lot of things that we incorporated and a handful of things that
					we wanted to incorporate into the webapp, we completed the app within a month
					and moved on to other projects. At first we made sure that we can graph simple
					things such as <code>x^2</code> and <code>e^x</code> and then we worked our
					way up from there. After we got the basics out of the way, we implemented
					points (both free moving points and points on a curve). At the same time
					we implemented calculus features into the graphing calculator, which you can
					view the Riemann's sum of the integral, get the derivative (to also get the
					tangent of the graph) and the second derivative. After creating the points
					I started to work on the geometry side of the app. By using the points the
					user can create lines, line segments, sectors of a circle, circles, parabolas,
					ellipses, hyperbolas, lagrange polynomials, and triangles. After which I
					implemented a custom function feature, so typing in
					<code>MyFunction(x) = 2 x ^ 3</code> will create a new function that all other
					entry boxes can now use, so typing in a new entry box
					<code>MyFunction(sin(x))</code> would produce a new graph that looks like
					this <code>2 (sin(x)) ^ 3</code>. During the time Desmos has not implemented
					their version of custom functions. As of right now, Desmos' custom function
					feature is limited to only a single letter such as
					<code>f(x) = x + 1</code> and <code>g(a, b, t) = a + t (b - a)</code>, however
					it is more robust by implementing piecewise functions, setting the range
					of the variables going into the function, and multiple variables.

				<a name="ithrowrock"><h2>iThrowRock</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					iThrowRock was an exploration into android development, although it was
					through the development of a hybrid app. It was created in JavaScript
					using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a>. It's a very simplistic
					game in which you throw rocks at bottles and try to get a high score.
					We worked in a team of a professor (to supervise) and two students
					(including myself).

				<p class="description">
					Roughly around the same time of creating iThrowRock, we also were working on
					an air hockey game. We also created a cabinet to host a touch screen
					monitor and a computer to run this game so that it has a pseudo air
					hockey table. It was made in JavaScript using
					<a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a> and it's a hybrid android app.

				<p class="description">
					This was a part of a <a href="projects.html#youtube-bot">different project</a>
					that didn't pan out (a bot that creates YouTube videos from simple scripts).
					However, upon showing a friend, I was requested to create an android app that
					makes clickbait looking thumbnails. So I ported it over using Xamarin because
					the code was made in C#. And because it was a joke to produce it on an Android
					platform, all the wording around the application is meant as a joke. Originally
					the name was just "üòÇüòÇC1icküÖ±Ô∏è8g3ner8orüòÇüòÇ", but because it was basically
					unsearchable I had to append "Clickbait Generator".

				<a name="csueb-vpat"><h2>VPAT Impact Analysis Form</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					This project was a request from my boss who wanted to automate a frankly lengthy
					process. It's a process done in every University, but for context I will be talking
					about the University I attended
					(<a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/">California State University, East Bay</a>).
					To the layman, a VPAT is an acronym for Voluntary Product Accessibility Template.
					Which is just a very long form that gives the reader a descriptive view of software
					in context to accessibility. Since the process of reviewing a VPAT to make sure the
					product is accessible, we must access whether or not the product is of high enough
					impact to warrant a review. That pre-review process was a pen and paper process that
					requires the reviewer to look up things about the product, communicate with the
					requester, and spot any contradictions. Typically, on average a single review can
					take about 2 weeks. Because it's such a slow process, there is a large backlog of
					reviews. And because the reviewer has to find contradictions, some can slip through
					as accessible; which results in a law suit against the school.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					We started by translating the paper form onto a web form and make it look the same.
					Then we gave it a points system, where lower impact options (such as Not Required
					for Academic Purposes) gives the user negative points to where higher impact options
					(such as Required for Academic Purposes) gives the user positive points. With this
					point system we gave a threshold of what would be a Low Impact, Low-Medium Impact,
					Medium Impact, Medium-High Impact, and High Impact. Which Low Impact is low enough
					of an impact that it is ok to let them purchase the product without any reprocussions
					and Low-Medium Impact is the same but with us explaining any discrepancies (e.g. The
					product is required for academic purposes, but it's a back-end product where no
					students will ever notice it's there).
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					Once we were done with the app and started using it for a while, we became much more
					efficient. A completed pre-VPAT review process went from taking us 2 weeks to within
					the same day it was submitted for review. And after some higher ups showed the app
					with other schools, we noticed that we have avoided loads of law suits that other
					universities has accidently gotten into. After which, we had the time to improve our
					efficiency, communication, workflow, and documentation on the process.
				</p>
