				<h2>Open Graphing Calculator</h2>
				
				<p class="description">
					This is an open source graphing calcultor that I collaborated with a math
					professor that was inspired by
					<a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a>. It was made using JavaScript,
					<a href="https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html">JSXGraph</a>,
					<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, and
					<a href="http://mathquill.com/">MathQuill</a>.
					There was a lot of things that we incorporated and a handful of things that
					we wanted to incorporate into the webapp, we completed the app within a month
					and moved on to other projects. At first we made sure that we can graph simple
					things such as <code>x^2</code> and <code>e^x</code> and then we worked our
					way up from there. After we got the basics out of the way, we implemented
					points (both free moving points and points on a curve). At the same time
					we implemented calculus features into the graphing calculator, which you can
					view the Riemann's sum of the integral, get the derivative (to also get the
					tangent of the graph) and the second derivative. After creating the points
					I started to work on the geometry side of the app. By using the points the
					user can create lines, line segments, sectors of a circle, circles, parabolas,
					ellipses, hyperbolas, lagrange polynomials, and triangles. After which I
					implemented a custom function feature, so typing in
					<code>MyFunction(x) = 2 x ^ 3</code> will create a new function that all other
					entry boxes can now use, so typing in a new entry box
					<code>MyFunction(sin(x))</code> would produce a new graph that looks like
					this <code>2 (sin(x)) ^ 3</code>

				<h2>iThrowRock</h2>
				
				<p class="description">
					iThrowRock was an exploration into android development, although it was
					through the development of a hybrid app. It was created in JavaScript
					using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a>. It's a very simplistic
					game in which you throw rocks at bottles and try to get a high score.
