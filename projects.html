				<a name="dream-game"><h2>Game About Dreams (Untitled)</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					The game was based on a handful of horrible dreams I have experienced,
					and I wanted to incorporate a lot of dream like oddities. The vision of
					the game is a mash-up of various genres typically involving some kind of
					psychadellic aspect to the genres. Each level tackles a different nightmare,
					with combat being active and reactive (such as Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga's
					combat where reacting to attacks can avoid or deal damage). In between levels
					the player would participate in mini-games that can benefit the player in
					each level (and these mini-games would reflect positive dreams).
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The proof of concepts were a level where the player can walk on walls and
					affect gravity and a mini-game of drifting down a mountain pass. The game
					was worked in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and was retired due to
					the base physics system conflicting with vision of the game. I looked for ways
					to get around it but didn't find anything. For now, it's shelved away until
					I find a way to fine tune a custom physics system within the engine.

				<a name="youtube-bot"><h2>YouTube Video Bot</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					This was an idea I had one day of wanting to make a YouTube channel, but put as little
					effort into editting as possible. The idea is that I create a bunch of scripts for the
					bot to read and it creates YouTube videos out of it every day I turn on my computer.
					I made it in C#.
					I named the bot after Alan Turing and Ada Lovelace and it's full name is Henry-Alan
					Lovelace (to get the acronym H.A.L.). I couldn't get
					<a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> to work programmically for some reason,
					so I instead was limited on using some super old API that Microsoft had lying around.
					It makes some super basic videos (just a blue screen with text), but I spent months
					getting the text-to-speech voice and text changes to sync up perfectly. Although
					the antiquated API being used can sometimes desync the audio and video.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The scripts that the robot would be fairly simple, such as the following below:
				</p>
				<div class="code-preview">
					<pre class="preview-file-name">channel_intro.package.json</pre>
					<pre class="preview">
  {
    "id": "channel_intro",
    "videoName": "channel_intro.wmv",
    "videoDescPackage": "channel_intro.desc.json",
    "refScripts": ["DefaultVideoScript.cs"],
    "properties": {
      "documentFile": "input/channel_intro.txt"
    }
  }					</pre>
				</div>
				
				<div class="code-preview">
					
					<pre class="preview-file-name">channel_intro.desc.json</pre>
					
					<pre class="preview">
{
	"title": "Channel Introduction",
	"desc": "Hello World! This is the introduction to my YouTube channel! Hope you guys like it ^_^",
	"privacy": "public",
	"category": "educational",
	"tags": ["channel", "introduction", "is", "there", "really", "something", "to", "say", "here?"]

Hello World! My name is Henry-Alan Lovelace. But you can call me Alan for short.
This is an introduction to my YouTube channel. This is where I would place opinion pieces (like game
design tips and tricks) and memes [airhorn] and such. Unfortunately, the creation of content has been delayed
for roughly half a year due to the lack of my writer's ability to place his thoughts into
words and therefore into video. Plus his lack of material.
[img|src=assets/shrug.png|len=00:00:01|anchor=middle]
But he is still working on it and hopefully this channel will actually post regularly.</pre>

				<p class="description">
					The first file contains all the relavent files needed to create a video. This
					includes the name of the file, special C# scripts that help render effects
					programmed within the script, specifics about the YouTube video, and the
					text to render into the video. I made it open ended so I don't have to make
					much work on the backend and be able to use it from the front end.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The second file contains all the information necessary for YouTube. This
					includes the name of the video, the description underneath the video,
					the tags, the category, and whether or not the video is private, public,
					or unlisted. The tags are used to create a
					<a href="products.html#clickbait-generator">clickbaity thumbnail</a>, if I
					remember correctly, there should be a way to set the thumbnail manually.
					However, I stopped working on the project before I was able to integrate
					the thumbnail into the video.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The last file contains all the information for the bot to create a video
					from. If you notice there are these weird command blocks that I make the
					bot parse: <code>[airhorn]</code> and
					<code>[img|src=assets/shrug.png|len=00:00:01|anchor=middle]</code>.
					Airhorn is the more simplified version of the commands. It's a preprogrammed
					version of two commands, an image and sound command, that shows an airhorn
					in the middle of the screen and plays the sound of an airhorn. The second
					command is a bit more complicated. The entire command contains no space, this
					is intential. I did not want to take the time to design a language for it to
					read, I just wanted the quick way of parsing each word by spaces, tabs, and
					new lines. So if I needed a command that writes text on the screen, then I
					would substitute <code>_</code> for an actual space. Since this was a private
					product, I didn't care that this was a hacky way of creating effects. Each
					parameter of the attribute is separated by <code>|</code>. Each command has
					it's own set of parameters, but the basic structure of assigning a parameter
					is <code>&lt;param_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					These three files the bot would create a YouTube video, as shown below in the Videos
					section. The bot had it's own email, in which I would zip up these files and email
					them to the bot. Every time I would turn on my computer, it would automatically run
					the bot, and it would read it's emails (deleting irrelevant emails and downloads data
					from relavent ones), pick a random script to make a video (if it's a new day and it
					hasn't made a video that day), create a video, upload the video, and post to Twitter
					that the video is up on YouTube. The point of it was to make me only worry about
					creating the scripts, and I can make a ton of scripts; the bot will take care of the
					rest making sure it doesn't spam.

				<a name="b3"><h2>B3 Engine & Editor</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					This is the current project I am working on. While I have made small game engines
					in the past (albeit efficient or inefficient), I never planned out how it should
					be made. Once I decided to invest my time into creating a game engine, I spent
					a good three months planning out what features it should have and hinting on
					how to go about it. As of currently, I am still laying down the groundswork.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The core idea of the engine is mod support and heavy leaning on giving the
					programmer more freedom in programming. I have used
					<a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>,
					<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal</a>,
					<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>,
					<a href="http://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>, and
					<a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a>. After using these, I really liked
					the programming freedom that MonoGame provides; however, it doesn't support
					3D animation and asset data is black boxed and so is meshes and models. I loved
					the open-source nature of Godot and the least amount of programming restrictions
					that it provides; even though including mods is incredibly easy it isn't intuitive.
					I have a lot of mixed feelings about Unity, but it is the most intuitive and easiest
					to develop games in; there are a lot of restrictions and forces the user to do a lot
					of hacky things (such as creating an entire GameObject just to run a script that keeps
					track of data). And also it resets static classes between scenes, which implies that
					it conjoins programs between scenes. So those three are my main inspiration and I
					want to take those problems that I've had and improve on them.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The engine is split into two programs: an engine and an editor. So that users who
					enjoy using engines such as MonoGame and Phaser.js can have the technical freedom
					that they desire. Knowing that there must be some black boxed objects to keep the
					back end running smoothly, I will keep the models and meshes open for the users
					interpretation (with some constraints) as well as providing the engine's
					interpretation, while leaving assets white boxed (as mod support is a feature of
					the engine). The editor, which is more akin to engines such as Godot and Unity,
					will be for the broader audience and is more of a toolset used to help create
					games with the engine. Which means that the code you used when using the engine
					alone can be used by the engine as well with no restrictions to it and the code
					generated by the engine is usable to the user with no restrictions (as it's
					generated to be used with the engine). This is to give the technical users more
					freedom of what they want. None of the generated code will hidden away or
					obfuscated, the point is for the users to have the least amount of restrictions
					in programming as possible.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					As previously mentioned before, mod support is a core feature of the engine (as
					mods give a new life to a game and bring in more people). So there is a built-in
					mod manager that lets the programmer decide whether or not to allow mods. And
					because mods are a core feature, the editor can import a game's library or
					executable and lets the user modify the game, making majority of the assets
					used in the editor readonly (as mods cannot remove outright unless there is some
					way in the game to programmically remove things). Majority of the time, game's
					with modable aspects need to create a second editor specific for modifications;
					the editor seeks to remedy that by having that be a built-in feature.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The engine and editor is made in C#, as it makes it easier to import mods and
					check the inner workings of the code and the application as it runs. For now
					it is using <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for the graphics,
					<a href="https://www.openal.org/">OpenAL</a> for the sound, using
					<a href="https://opentk.net/">OpenTK</a> as a
					wrapper to using those libraries. The engine is open-source and planned to
					be freeware (just like <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>).
					Currently, I am working on getting the base mathematics working. I did not want to
					reinvent the wheel, but if the community decides that it should support more
					graphic apis other than OpenGL (like DirectX), then the mathematics must be
					contain within the engine to allow users to switch between graphic libraries.
					Because I am still working on the mathematics, there is nothing in the <code>master</code>
					branch of the repository of the engine; but there is code working on the <code>develop</code>
					branch.

				<a name="paml"><h2>PAML</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					PAML is an acronym for Paul's Assistive Mathematics Library, and was originally
					intended for a supplementary library. A professor asked for me to create a web
					app to help students understand the
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_undetermined_coefficients">methods
					of undetermined coefficient</a> problem in differential equations. So I worked on
					a prototype, and his response was "What if I want to do these equations in terms of
					Y instead of X?" And I started work on my own computer algebra system, as I was
					previously using <a href="http://algebrite.org/">Algebrite</a> (but is only in
					terms of x). So PAML is a computer algebra system in which the user can derive and
					intergrate variables that the users want. After a while, the system went from a
					supplementary library to the main focus of the project. I got the basics to work,
					using a parse tree to understand the input of the user. But a big problem arose,
					moving around parts of the equation become difficult the larger and more complex
					the equation became; plus the tree would lean towards one side and fill the rest
					to the other side at the very bottom of the tree or the second to last thing of the
					tree.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					To remedy this, I came up with a system that chops up parts of the equation into a
					list of "buckets" and those buckets have their own parse tree. Each bucket is marked
					by a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>. So the equation: 1 + sin(x - 3) ^ 2 - (1 - x);
					would be split into three buckets: <code>+ 1</code>, <code>+ sin(x - 3) ^ 2</code>,
					and <code>- (1 - x)</code>. And anything in parenthesis would be a sub equation and
					would follow the same rules, so <code>x - 3</code> would be split into <code>+ x</code>
					and <code>- 3</code>. This makes it easier to move around parts of the equation
					algebraically. So <code>1 + sin(x - 3) ^ 2 - (1 - x)</code> moving around to
					<code>sin(x - 3) ^ 2 - (1 - x) + 1</code> would O(1) as it just moves from index 0
					to index 2. I do notice that this might increase space complexity. After 6 months, I
					had to rework how it works and ended up shelving this project for later; so that
					when I am prepared, I will plan out how it should work and then work on it. I was
					able to derive and evaluate with it, so I was able to graph 3D functions with it.
					Any applications and images of that were however on an old broken hard drive, so
					I unfortunately don't have any images for this project.
