				<a name="dream-game"><h2>Game About Dreams (Untitled)</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					The game was based on a handful of horrible dreams I have experienced,
					and I wanted to incorporate a lot of dream like oddities. The vision of
					the game is a mash-up of various genres typically involving some kind of
					psychadellic aspect to the genres. Each level tackles a different nightmare,
					with combat being active and reactive (such as Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga's
					combat where reacting to attacks can avoid or deal damage). In between levels
					the player would participate in mini-games that can benefit the player in
					each level (and these mini-games would reflect positive dreams).
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The proof of concepts were a level where the player can walk on walls and
					affect gravity and a mini-game of drifting down a mountain pass. The game
					was worked in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and was retired due to
					the base physics system conflicting with vision of the game. I looked for ways
					to get around it but didn't find anything. For now, it's shelved away until
					I find a way to fine tune a custom physics system within the engine.

				<a name="youtube-bot"><h2>YouTube Video Bot</h2></a>
				
				<p class="description">
					This was an idea I had one day of wanting to make a YouTube channel, but put as little
					effort into editting as possible. The idea is that I create a bunch of scripts for the
					bot to read and it creates YouTube videos out of it every day I turn on my computer.
					I made it in C#.
					I named the bot after Alan Turing and Ada Lovelace and it's full name is Henry-Alan
					Lovelace (to get the acronym H.A.L.). I couldn't get
					<a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> to work programmically for some reason,
					so I instead was limited on using some super old API that Microsoft had lying around.
					It makes some super basic videos (just a blue screen with text), but I spent months
					getting the text-to-speech voice and text changes to sync up perfectly. Although
					the antiquated API being used can sometimes desync the audio and video.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The scripts that the robot would be fairly simple, such as the following below:
				</p>
				<div class="code-preview">
					<pre class="preview-file-name">channel_intro.package.json</pre>
					<pre class="preview">
  {
    "id": "channel_intro",
    "videoName": "channel_intro.wmv",
    "videoDescPackage": "channel_intro.desc.json",
    "refScripts": ["DefaultVideoScript.cs"],
    "properties": {
      "documentFile": "input/channel_intro.txt"
    }
  }					</pre>
				</div>
				
				<div class="code-preview">
					
					<pre class="preview-file-name">channel_intro.desc.json</pre>
					
					<pre class="preview">
{
	"title": "Channel Introduction",
	"desc": "Hello World! This is the introduction to my YouTube channel! Hope you guys like it ^_^",
	"privacy": "public",
	"category": "educational",
	"tags": ["channel", "introduction", "is", "there", "really", "something", "to", "say", "here?"]

Hello World! My name is Henry-Alan Lovelace. But you can call me Alan for short.
This is an introduction to my YouTube channel. This is where I would place opinion pieces (like game
design tips and tricks) and memes [airhorn] and such. Unfortunately, the creation of content has been delayed
for roughly half a year due to the lack of my writer's ability to place his thoughts into
words and therefore into video. Plus his lack of material.
[img|src=assets/shrug.png|len=00:00:01|anchor=middle]
But he is still working on it and hopefully this channel will actually post regularly.</pre>

					The first file contains all the relavent files needed to create a video. This
					includes the name of the file, special C# scripts that help render effects
					programmed within the script, specifics about the YouTube video, and the
					text to render into the video. I made it open ended so I don't have to make
					much work on the backend and be able to use it from the front end.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The second file contains all the information necessary for YouTube. This
					includes the name of the video, the description underneath the video,
					the tags, the category, and whether or not the video is private, public,
					or unlisted. The tags are used to create a
					<a href="products.html#clickbait-generator">clickbaity thumbnail</a>, if I
					remember correctly, there should be a way to set the thumbnail manually.
					However, I stopped working on the project before I was able to integrate
					the thumbnail into the video.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The last file contains all the information for the bot to create a video
					from. If you notice there are these weird command blocks that I make the
					bot parse: <code>[airhorn]</code> and
					<code>[img|src=assets/shrug.png|len=00:00:01|anchor=middle]</code>.
					Airhorn is the more simplified version of the commands. It's a preprogrammed
					version of two commands, an image and sound command, that shows an airhorn
					in the middle of the screen and plays the sound of an airhorn. The second
					command is a bit more complicated. The entire command contains no space, this
					is intential. I did not want to take the time to design a language for it to
					read, I just wanted the quick way of parsing each word by spaces, tabs, and
					new lines. So if I needed a command that writes text on the screen, then I
					would substitute <code>_</code> for an actual space. Since this was a private
					product, I didn't care that this was a hacky way of creating effects. Each
					parameter of the attribute is separated by <code>|</code>. Each command has
					it's own set of parameters, but the basic structure of assigning a parameter
					is <code>&lt;param_name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>.
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					These three files the bot would create a YouTube video, as shown below in the Videos
					section. The bot had it's own email, in which I would zip up these files and email
					them to the bot. Every time I would turn on my computer, it would automatically run
					the bot, and it would read it's emails (deleting irrelevant emails and downloads data
					from relavent ones), pick a random script to make a video (if it's a new day and it
					hasn't made a video that day), create a video, upload the video, and post to Twitter
					that the video is up on YouTube. The point of it was to make me only worry about
					creating the scripts, and I can make a ton of scripts; the bot will take care of the
					rest making sure it doesn't spam.
