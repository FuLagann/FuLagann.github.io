				<h2>Game About Dreams (Untitled)</h2>
				
				<p class="description">
					The game was based on a handful of horrible dreams I have experienced,
					and I wanted to incorporate a lot of dream like oddities. The vision of
					the game is a mash-up of various genres typically involving some kind of
					psychadellic aspect to the genres. Each level tackles a different nightmare,
					with combat being active and reactive (such as Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga's
					combat where reacting to attacks can avoid or deal damage). In between levels
					the player would participate in mini-games that can benefit the player in
					each level (and these mini-games would reflect positive dreams).
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The proof of concepts were a level where the player can walk on walls and
					affect gravity and a mini-game of drifting down a mountain pass. The game
					was worked in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and was retired due to
					the base physics system conflicting with vision of the game. I looked for ways
					to get around it but didn't find anything. For now, it's shelved away until
					I find a way to fine tune a custom physics system within the engine.
