				The following is my personal and professional web pages dedicated to the
				projects I have done and a showcasing of them. The projects under
				<a href="#products">Products</a> are completed projects that can be used
				publically, while projects under <a href="#projects">Projects</a> are
				projects that were not completed, pivotted, or currently in the works.
				This website is mainly used as a portfolio (as showcasing projects and
				techniques) but will be used with demonstrating and explaining techniques,
				methods, algorithms, and concepts later in the future.

				<h3>iThrowRock</h3>
				
				<p class="description">
					iThrowRock was an exploration into android development, although it was
					through the development of a hybrid app. It was created in JavaScript
					using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a>. It's a very simplistic
					game in which you throw rocks at bottles and try to get a high score.

				<h3>Game About Dreams (Untitled)</h3>
				
				<p class="description">
					The game was based on a handful of horrible dreams I have experienced,
					and I wanted to incorporate a lot of dream like oddities. The vision of
					the game is a mash-up of various genres typically involving some kind of
					psychadellic aspect to the genres. Each level tackles a different nightmare,
					with combat being active and reactive (such as Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga's
					combat where reacting to attacks can avoid or deal damage). In between levels
					the player would participate in mini-games that can benefit the player in
					each level (and these mini-games would reflect positive dreams).
				</p>
				
				<p class="description">
					The proof of concepts were a level where the player can walk on walls and
					affect gravity and a mini-game of drifting down a mountain pass. The game
					was worked in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and was retired due to
					the base physics system conflicting with vision of the game. I looked for ways
					to get around it but didn't find anything. For now, it's shelved away until
					I find a way to fine tune a custom physics system within the engine.
