				<h3>iThrowRock</h3>
				
				<p class="description">
					iThrowRock was an exploration into android development, although it was
					through the development of a hybrid app. It was created in JavaScript
					using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser.js</a>. It's a very simplistic
					game in which you throw rocks at bottles and try to get a high score.
